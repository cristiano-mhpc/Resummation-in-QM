This folder contains the relevant codes used for the computation of the respective ground-state energies of each of the quantum systems considered in the paper. The folder FUNNEL for the funnel potential, PT_SYMM for the PT-Symmetric cubic oscillator, Quartic for the Quartic anharmonic oscillator and Sextic_Oscillator for the sextic anharmonic oscillator. 
  

The results are published in this [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2023.0098)
